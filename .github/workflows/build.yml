      # Note: For a real Electron build/release, we would use electron-builder here.
      # Since electron-builder is not yet fully configured in package.json, 
      # this step currently verifies that the project builds without errors.
      # To enable full release:
      # 1. Add electron-builder to devDependencies
      # 2. Add "build": "electron-builder" to scripts
      # 3. Uncomment the following step:
      
      # - name: Build Electron App
      #   run: npm run electron:build
      #   env:
      #     GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
